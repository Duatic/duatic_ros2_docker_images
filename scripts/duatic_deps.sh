# duatic-deps — install every dependency a workspace's src/ declares (rosdep keys, every
# Aptfile, every requirements.txt, at any depth), leniently, into the RUNNING container.
#
# The entry point for duatic-rosdep-install and duatic-install-extra-deps in a running
# container. Not persisted across container recreation: re-run it after recreating the
# container, or whenever src/ gains a new dependency.
#
# Usage: duatic-deps [--if-changed | --list | --gate] [src_dir]   (default: $ROS_WS/src, e.g. /ros2_ws/src)
#   --if-changed  skip the install when every manifest in src_dir is already in /etc/duatic/deps.stamp
#   --list        print the checksum and path of every manifest in src_dir and exit
#   --gate        fail, listing them, when the image holds unresolved dependencies: the strict
#                 gate the robot image and CI hold
#
# The stamp lists every manifest already installed. An image that installs a workspace's
# dependencies at build time writes it with --list, and each complete install adds to it, so a
# container whose src/ holds no new or changed manifest skips.
